## Components Required
-  8 Relay channel with ESP32 board (Custom-designed in EasyEDA)
- Motor drivers (e.g., H-bridges or motor driver modules)
- Additional components based on your robot's requirements (e.g., motors, sensors, chassis)
  
## Design Steps
1. Setup EasyEDA Project
- Open EasyEDA and create a new project.

3. Design Custom Board
- Utilize EasyEDA's schematic editor to design the 8 Relay channel with ESP32 board with 8 relays and an ESP32 microcontroller.
- Include necessary components such as voltage regulators, connectors, and headers.
- Ensure proper layout and connectivity for relay control and ESP32 interfacing.
  
3. Place Other Components
- Add motor drivers to control the four wheels of the robot base.
- Include any additional components like sensors or actuators required for your robot design.
  
4. Connect Components
- Connect the output pins of the 8 Relay channel with ESP32 board to the input pins of the motor drivers.
- Wire the motor drivers to the motors of the robot base.
- Connect any sensors or other peripherals to the appropriate pins on the ESP32 board.
  
5. Power Supply
- Ensure that the power supply for the motors and other components is sufficient and properly regulated.
- Connect the power supply to the motor drivers and ESP32 board as per their specifications.
  
6. Programming
- Develop the firmware for the ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible development environment.
- Implement the necessary control algorithms to drive the motors based on sensor inputs or user commands.
  
7. PCB Design
- Once the schematic is complete, proceed to design the PCB layout.
- Arrange the components on the PCB and route the traces to ensure proper connectivity.
- Pay attention to ground planes and signal integrity to avoid interference and ensure reliable operation.
  
8. Fabrication and Assembly
- Export the PCB layout files from EasyEDA and order fabrication from a PCB manufacturer.
- Once the PCBs are ready, assemble the components onto the board, following standard soldering practices.
